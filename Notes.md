## Rendering
SSR: Server Side Rendering and CSR: Client Side Rendering 
SSR (Server Side Rendering): Rendering web pages on the server and sending the fully rendered HTML pages to the client's browser. This approach is SEO-friendly and provides faster initial page load. but to have interactivity we need to use client side rendering by addying "use client" keyword at the top of the file componet

CSR (Client Side Rendering): Rendering web pages primarily on the client side using JavaScript frameworks. The initial HTML page is minimal, and the content is dynamically rendered on the client's browser, resulting in rich interactivity and enhanced performance after the initial load.
